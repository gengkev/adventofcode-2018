I interpreted the assembly manually, wrote it in C, and... apparently
this was just what you had to do to solve it in a reasonable amount of time.

With a bit less reading one could have seen that register 0 was only read
on line 28, which is enough to get the first star with simulation. But
getting the second star with simulation takes quite some time.

I think the problem here was also just not knowing what to do, and also
getting confused by the flavor text...
